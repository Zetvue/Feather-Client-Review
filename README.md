# Feather Client Review
Well, here's the reduxed version.

## Disclaimers
This is just one person's experience. Yours may be different, and that's okay.

I am biased against Feather, so take this review with a grain of salt.

I'm not trying to take down Feather, I'm just giving my honest opinion on it.

I have a low end computer. This in no way will match your experience. If you have a good enough computer that can run Vanilla with ease, why even bother?

**Don't harass the developers and mods. You know who you are.**

## Performance

`MODS USED FOR THIS SECTION: Optifine, Patcher ONLY`

Performance isn't the best.

Coupled with a horrible mod loader (Forge) and its Chromium GUI, its performance is *really* low, even with optimization mods like Optifine and Patcher.

Speaking of Chromium, they use outside processes to render a GUI. This is a very horrible idea, as you have processes running in the background that decrease your frames even more. And the worst part? It's wholly unoptimized, and you can't even turn off those! They are essential to rendering the GUI!

With my experience with the Chromium GUI, it severely lags behind. I don't feel like recording another video showing that it lags behind, so here's [this videp.](https://streamable.com/rexroe)

Brend4n, the creator of Feather Client, also confirmed this wasn't great for low end computers like my own.

He also said that the Chromium GUI won't be going away any time soon.

### Ingame

Ingame is.. decent. It's worse than regular Forge for me, with it feeling more choppy than Forge.

Trying to configure the GUI is a pain though, it feels clunky and, as I've said before, it severely lags behind. The icons were not pleasing to look at either.

Some mods are now compatible with Feather, which is nice.

## GUI

This is where my real pain starts with the client.

For starters, it's an ugly mix of filled and not filled. 

E.g., why is the Settings icon outlined in the launcher but not ingame?

Yet it's also outlined in the sidebar for Feather mods??

Why are other icons outlines, and other ones filled?

It looks inconsistent. These may not matter to you, but they certainly matter to me.

We haven't even gotten to the mod menu yet.

This is just a clusterfuck at this point. Icons of inconsistent stroke thickness, fill, and pixel size, and not to mention being smooth and not smooth.

For the Feather devs, please use [Phosphor Icons](https://phosphoricons.com). It's a really good item set, and will improve the look of the client.

## Conclusion

Should you buy feather? I dunno, your choice.

I personally recommend against using Feather, but I can't stop you from using it.

If you want some alternatives to Feather, here are a few:

For people who prefer doing stuff manually, [here's a guide for 1.8.9](https://github.com/LizzyMaybeDev/Introduction-to-modding-mc), an [alternatives list](https://microcontrollersdev.github.io/Alternatives) for the most popular clients and mods, and [a guide for the latest versions](https://github.com/MicrocontrollersDev/MigratingToLatest).

For people who just want an easier experience downloading mods, [SkyClient](https://skyclient.co) has a curated list of mods that you can pick and choose (1.8.9), and [PolyMC](https://polymc.org) has an in-built mod downloader that downloads from CurseForge and Modrinth.

If you really don't feel like getting into using mod loaders, you can stick to the client you're currently using.
