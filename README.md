# Feather Client Review
Well, here's the reduxed version.

## Disclaimers
This is just one person's experience. Yours may be different, and that's okay.

I am biased against Feather, so take this review with a grain of salt.

I'm not trying to take down Feather, I'm just giving my honest opinion on it.

I have a low end computer. This in no way will match your experience. If you have a good enough computer that can run Vanilla with ease, why even bother?

**Don't harass the developers and mods. You know who you are.**

## Performance

`MODS USED FOR THIS SECTION: Optifine, Patcher ONLY`

Performance isn't the best.

Coupled with a horrible mod loader (Forge) and its Chromium GUI, its performance is *really* low, even with optimization mods like Optifine and Patcher.

Speaking of Chromium, they use outside processes to render a GUI. This is a very horrible idea, as you have processes running in the background that decrease your frames even more. And the worst part? It's wholly unoptimized, and you can't even turn off those! They are essential to rendering the GUI!

With my experience with the Chromium GUI, it severely lags behind. I don't feel like recording another video showing that it lags behind, so here's [this videp.](https://streamable.com/rexroe)

Brend4n, the creator of Feather Client, also confirmed this wasn't great for low end computers like my own.

He also said that the Chromium GUI won't be going away any time soon.

### Ingame

Ingame is.. decent. It's worse than regular Forge for me, with it feeling more choppy than Forge.

Trying to configure the GUI is a pain though, it feels clunky and, as I've said before, it severely lags behind. The icons were not pleasing to look at either.

Some mods are now compatible with Feather, which is nice.

## GUI

This is where my real pain starts with the client.
